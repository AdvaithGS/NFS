    <ul>
      <li><b>Go back to the homepage and rethink your life</b><br> Maybe you'll get it right then</li><br>
      <li><b>Double-Check the url name</b><br> Don't tell anyone, though. It's embarassing really.</li><br>
      <li><b>Blame your stupidity and move on</b><br> Highly recommended</li><br>
